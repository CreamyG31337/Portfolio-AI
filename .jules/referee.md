## 2026-07-23 - Watchlist upsert source overwrite logic bug
**Issue:** `upsert_watchlist_ticker` intended to preserve provenance (`source`) of ideas but unconditionally passed `source` to `supabase.table.upsert()`, which clobbered existing values on conflict.
**Learning:** Supabase `upsert` updates all provided keys on conflict. A comment warning not to do it is insufficient; the function itself must enforce it.
**Prevention:** If an upsert must preserve an existing column, perform a `select` first to fetch the original value and explicitly pass it back in the `upsert` payload.
