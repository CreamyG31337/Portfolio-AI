## 2025-02-12 - Auth Forms and Button Semantics
**Learning:** Users often scan authentication forms quickly. Adding placeholders (e.g., `name@example.com`, `••••••••`) significantly improves usability by providing a visual hint of the expected input format. Also, explicitly setting `type="button"` on buttons that are not intended to submit forms is crucial to prevent unexpected behavior and adhere to HTML standards.
**Action:** Always check for placeholders in form inputs and verify button types in future UI enhancements.
